# Replace Gulf of America with Gulf of Mexico on Websites Extension
Cove Brook Coders, LLC.
Brian Kresge

This boring little extension will just find and replace "Gulf of America" with "Gulf of Mexico."  Not in maps, we'll work on that, though.

Allow yourself to briefly pretend we don't live in the idiotic time we live in.

## Installation Instructions

* Download release of this extension
* Go to edge://extensions or chrome://extensions (this'll work in both)
* Turn on Developer Mode
* Unzip the release locally, click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder for the extension
* Wala, you can preserve a comforting illusion
